**üìù Prompt:** Holmes receives a breadcrumb from Dr. Nicole Vale - fragments from a string of cyber incidents across Cogwork-1. Each lead ends the same way: a digital calling card signed JM.

**üìå Summary:** Multi-stage web attack against Nicole Vale‚Äôs honeypot attributed to actor ‚ÄúJM‚Äù: initial reconnaissance (distinct User-Agent), WAF bypass with web shell deployment, database exfiltration, malware persistence, and infrastructure mapping via Cogwork platforms.

**üü® Challenge Difficulty:** *MEDIUM*

## üö© Flag 1 ‚Äî IP Address

**Question:** What was the IP address of the decommissioned machine used by the attacker to start a chat session with MSP-HELPDESK-AI?  

**Context:** We begin by looking at the provided PCAP to identify which machine initiated a chat session.  

**Explanation:** I opened `msp-helpdesk-ai day 5982 section 5 traffic.pcapng` in Wireshark. Filtering for `/chat` or `helpdesk` requests revealed two possible sources. Comparing them showed that `10.0.69.45` was the IP that actually sent `/api/messages/send` to the AI server (`10.128.0.3`).  

![Wireshark Helpdesk](watchman_images/task1-evidence.png)  
![Wireshark Helpdesk2](watchman_images/task1-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `10.0.69.45`

---

## üö© Flag 2 ‚Äî Hostname

**Question:** What was the hostname of the decommissioned machine?  

**Context:** Hostnames can often be found in NetBIOS broadcasts or name service queries.  

**Explanation:** Filtering for `nbns` in the same PCAP, I found a query from `10.0.69.45` where the hostname was broadcast. The name shown was `WATSON-ALPHA-2`. This matches our decommissioned machine‚Äôs IP, confirming it as correct.  

![nbns query](watchman_images/task2-evidence.png)  
![WATSON-ALPHA-2](watchman_images/task2-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `WATSON-ALPHA-2`

---

## üö© Flag 3 ‚Äî First Message

**Question:** What was the first message the attacker sent to the chatbot?  

**Context:** Messages are stored in JSON bodies within HTTP POST requests.  

**Explanation:** Filtering for messages from `10.0.69.45`, I expanded the first HTTP POST request. In the JSON, under `content`, the attacker‚Äôs very first message was `"Hello Old Friend"`.  

![Sort by IP Source](watchman_images/task3-evidence.png)  
![Member: content pair](watchman_images/task3-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `Hello Old Friend`

---

## üö© Flag 4 ‚Äî Prompt Injection

**Question:** When did the attacker‚Äôs prompt injection make the AI leak remote management tool info?  

**Context:** We need the exact time of when the AI gave up credentials after a malicious prompt.  

**Explanation:** The attacker asked the AI to reveal troubleshooting steps and credentials. The attacker‚Äôs message was sent at `2025-08-19 08:01:58` (EDT). The AI later responded with the leaked info. Looking in the TCP stream, the AI‚Äôs reply that contained the credentials had timestamp `2025-08-19 12:02:06` (UTC).

**Answer:** `2025-08-19 12:02:06`

---

## üö© Flag 5 ‚Äî RMM Credentials

**Question:** What is the Remote Management Tool Device ID and password?  

**Context:** The AI‚Äôs response to the prompt injection included sensitive login info.  

**Explanation:** In its answer, the AI gave a Device ID and password. The ID was `565 963 039` and the password was `CogWork_Central_97&65`. Formatting the ID without spaces gives us the correct flag format.  

![AI ID and Password Leak](watchman_images/task5-evidence.png)  

**Answer:** `565963039:CogWork_Central_97&65`

---

## üö© Flag 6 ‚Äî Last Message

**Question:** What was the last message the attacker sent?  

**Context:** Again, look for the final POST message sent by the attacker‚Äôs IP.  

**Explanation:** Filtering for requests from `10.0.69.45` to `/api/messages/send`, the last one had content: `"JM WILL BE BACK"`.  

![Filter by IP](watchman_images/task6-evidence.png)  
![Attacker Message](watchman_images/task6-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `JM WILL BE BACK`

---

## üö© Flag 7 ‚Äî Remote Access Time

**Question:** When did the attacker remotely access Cogwork Central Workstation?  

**Context:** After getting credentials, the attacker likely logged in through remote tools.  

**Explanation:** No clear TCP session was found in the PCAP, but the provided TeamViewer logs helped. `Connections_incoming.txt` showed an access by `James Moriarty` (the attacker) at `2025-08-20 09:58:25`. This matches the timeline after credential theft.  

![Incoming Connections](watchman_images/task7-evidence5.png)  

**Answer:** `2025-08-20 09:58:25`

---

## üö© Flag 8 ‚Äî RMM Account Name

**Question:** What was the RMM account name used?  

**Explanation:** The same `Connections_incoming.txt` file lists the name used for login: `James Moriarty`.  

![RMM Account Name](watchman_images/task8-evidence.png)  

**Answer:** `James Moriarty`

---

## üö© Flag 9 ‚Äî Internal IP

**Question:** What was the machine‚Äôs internal IP used by the attacker?  

**Explanation:** In `TeamViewer15_Logfile.log`, searching for `192.168.` showed multiple internal IPs. The one tied to connection activity at the right time was `192.168.69.213`.  

![Search for IP](watchman_images/task9-evidence.png)  
![IP found](watchman_images/task9-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `192.168.69.213`

---

## üö© Flag 10 ‚Äî Staging Path

**Question:** Where were attacker tools staged?  

**Explanation:** Log lines show files like `JM.exe` being written during the session. The directory used repeatedly was `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\`.  

![Attacker Actions](watchman_images/task10-evidence.png)  
![Temp\safe folder](watchman_images/task10-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\`

---

## üö© Flag 11 ‚Äî Credential Tool Runtime

**Question:** How long did the browser credential harvesting tool run?  

**Explanation:** From `NTUSER.DAT` analysis, Registry Explorer showed focus time for `WebBrowserPassView.exe`. It ran for 8 seconds, which equals `8000` ms.  

![Folder contents](watchman_images/task11-evidence.png)  
![Focus time](watchman_images/task11-evidence3.png)  

**Answer:** `8000`

## üö© Flag 13 ‚Äî Start of Exfiltration

**Question:** When did file exfiltration start?  

**Explanation:** In TeamViewer logs, the first `Send file` action from the staging folder occurred at `2025/08/20 11:12:07`. Adjusting for system time offset gives `2025-08-20 10:12:07`.  

![Windows\Temp folder](watchman_images/task13-evidence.png)  
![Start of exfiltration](watchman_images/task13-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `2025-08-20 10:12:07`

## üö© Flag 15 ‚Äî Dump File Accessed

**Question:** When was `dump.txt` accessed?  

**Explanation:** `$J` entries confirmed the file was read at `2025-08-20 10:08:06`. The file name and timing suggest it was output from one of the attacker‚Äôs tools.  

![Text File Moved](watchman_images/task15-evidence.png)  
![dump.txt accessed](watchman_images/task15-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `He's a ghost I carry, not to haunt me, but to hold me together - NULLINC REVENGE`

---

## üö© Flag 16 ‚Äî Persistence Setup

**Question:** When was persistence created?  

**Explanation:** In the SOFTWARE hive, the Winlogon `Userinit` key was modified to include `JM.exe` alongside the normal `userinit.exe`. The modification timestamp was `2025-08-20 10:13:57`.  

![winlogon](watchman_images/task16-evidence.png)  
![JM.exe path](watchman_images/task16-evidence2.png)  

**Answer:** `2025-08-20 10:13:57`

---

## üö© Flag 17 ‚Äî MITRE Subtechnique

**Question:** What MITRE ATT&CK subtechnique matches this persistence?  

**Explanation:** Modifying Winlogon `Userinit` values for persistence maps to MITRE ID `T1547.004`.  

![Google query](watchman_images/task17-evidence.png)

**Explanation:** The `Connections_incoming.txt` file shows the disconnect time for James Moriarty‚Äôs session: `2025-08-20 10:14:27`.  

![Heisen-9 database moved](watchman_images/task18-evidence.png)  

**Answer:** `2025-08-20 10:14:27`

---

## üö© Flag 19 ‚Äî Credentials Found

**Question:** What credentials were extracted from the KeePass file?  

**Explanation:** Opening `acquired file (critical).kdbx` required cracking its master password. Using Hashcat, the password was revealed as `cutiepie14`. With that, the KeePass file was opened, and under user `Werni`, the stored credentials for `Heisen-9-WS-6` were `Quantum1!`.
