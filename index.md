**Experience Overall**

From September 22â€“26, 2025, I competed alongside five teammates in my first-ever defensive Capture the Flag (CTF) as part of Hack The Boxâ€™s first Blue Team CTF.

Out of 7,085 teams worldwide, our team placed 634th overall, finishing in the top 8% globally.


This competition was an incredible opportunity to apply classroom knowledge of cybersecurity to real-world scenarios involving SOC operations,

DFIR, malware reversing, and threat intelligence. With limited preparation resources available, we focused on teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure.

**Key takeaways:**

- Learned to rapidly adopt and apply new tools and techniques during live challenges.

- Strengthened collaboration and communication by dividing tasks and sharing findings efficiently.

- Experienced the thrill of translating conceptual cybersecurity topics into real-world defense strategies.

**Conclusion**

This event solidified my passion for cybersecurity and highlighted the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and teamwork in defending against modern threats.

Use your ace intellect to solve the crimes in Cogwork-1.


**Consider this our official debrief.**

Holmes left some vague context (as he does) before heading out into the field. Hereâ€™s what we know: 

We are getting strange readings from around the city; there were some targeted attacks on local businesses that seemed off. Who was chosen and the type of attack piqued Holmesâ€™ interest, so he set out ahead of us. 

Odd thoughâ€¦ he was muttering about something that had happened a while back, and he expressed distress about a personal AI he developed named WATSON. 

See, WATSON was his collaborative ally in his attempts to curb the crime happening around the city. However, some time ago, a catastrophic false-alert event caused by WATSON triggered a year-long manhunt for a breach that never existed. We were chasing ghosts.  

Reputations ruined. Careers ended. The entire city was paralyzed over a phantom that was in our own backyard. The event known as NULLINC caused Holmes to shut down his creation, his friend. 

So, we are just as confused about why heâ€™d mention WATSON now, but you never can get a read on that man. 

Head out into the field and assist him in finding out whatâ€™s going on. We are counting on your detectives.
