**Prompt:** With the malware extracted, Holmes inspects its logic. The strain spreads silently across the entire network. Its goal? Not destruction, something more persistentâ€¦friends. NOTE: The downloaded file is active malware. Take the necessary precautions when attempting this challenge.

**Summary:** A malware sample that spreads laterally and focuses on stealthy persistence was extracted for defensive analysis. The objectives are to reverse-engineer its behavior (imports, GUIDs/COM usage, opcodes, and crypto/key derivation), recover and decrypt its killswitch domain, and verify findings in a safe lab. Finally, block that domain inside an isolated Docker test network so the sample cannot phone home during analysis.
